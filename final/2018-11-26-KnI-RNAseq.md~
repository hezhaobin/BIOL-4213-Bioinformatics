# Introduction
In the study of Brooks et al. 2011, the authors wanted to identify exons regulated by the Pasilla gene (the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 proteins) using RNA sequencing data. They depleted the Pasilla (PS) gene in Drosophila melanogaster by RNA interference (RNAi).

Total RNA was then isolated and used to prepare both single-end and paired-end RNA-seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain RNA-seq reads for each sample. The RNA-seq data for the treated and the untreated samples can be then compared to identify the effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events.

In this tutorial, we will reproduce the analysis of the RNA-Seq data step by step.

The original data is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE18508.

In this tutorial we will use the first 7 samples:

4 untreated samples: GSM461176, GSM461177, GSM461178, GSM461182
3 treated samples (Pasilla gene depleted by RNAi): GSM461179, GSM461180, GSM461181
Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

The raw RNA-seq reads have been extracted from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) files and converted into FASTQ files. In the first part of this tutorial we will use the files for 2 of the 7 samples, to demonstrate analysis of FASTQs. Optionally later you can import the FASTQs for the other 5 samples.
